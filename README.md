Hi there!

I'm GreyBeard42 a JavaScript hobbiest who likes old media (I have a collection of Cassettes)

I also like to take lots of pictures when I go traveling ([view that here](https://greybeard42.github.io/photography))

I'm currently learning Lua for PICO-8 and Picotron.

I don't actually have a Beard. Don't question it. Why would I.
